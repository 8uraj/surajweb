 * reducing draw calls and improving performance in many cases. If you're not sure that identical
 * Meshes share vertex data and materials ("linked duplicates"), run {@link dedup} first to link them.

 * Example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import { dedup, instance } from '@gltf-transform/functions';
 *
 * await document.transform(
 * 	dedup(),
 * 	instance({min: 2}),
 * );
