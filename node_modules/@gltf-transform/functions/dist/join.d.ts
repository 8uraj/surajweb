 * in the scene hierarchy. For best results, apply {@link dedup} and
 * {@link flatten} first to maximize the number of Primitives that

 *
 * NOTE: In a Scene that heavily reuses the same Mesh data, joining may
 * increase vertex count. Consider alternatives, like
 * {@link instance instancing} with {@link EXTMeshGPUInstancing}.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { PropertyType } from '@gltf-transform/core';
 * import { join, flatten, dedup } from '@gltf-transform/functions';
 *
 * await document.transform(
 * 	dedup({ propertyTypes: [PropertyType.MATERIAL] }),
 * 	flatten(),
 * 	join({ keepNamed: false }),
 * );
 * ```
